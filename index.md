## Introduction
This page combines static html generated by [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) from markdown files that can include multiple React components. It is generated from the files in the gh-pages branch of [this GitHub template](https://github.com/dellaert/gh-pages-jekyll-react). 

Below is one component:

<div id="component_1"></div>
<br/>

And here is another one:

<div id="component_2"></div>
<br/>

In addition, as is customary with Jekyll sites, the `News` tab is generated based on markdown files in the `_posts` folder.

## Code Structure
The above is rendered based on this markdown code in `index.md`:

```md
Below is one component:

<div id="component_1"></div>

And here is another one:

<div id="component_2"></div>
```

and the code in [src/entry.jsx](/src/entry.jsx) which renders the React components in `src/components` into the divs above:

``` js
ReactDOM.render(<Component1 />, document.getElementById('component_1'));
ReactDOM.render(<Component2 />, document.getElementById('component_2'));
```

The components in [src/components/component1.jsx](/src/components/component1.jsx) and [src/components/component2.jsx](/src/components/component2.jsx) are based on basic examples in the [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started/introduction) project.

## Development
To start development based on this, clone this [this GitHub template](https://github.com/dellaert/gh-pages-jekyll-react), check out the gh-pages branch, and edit the .md and .jsx files (in the src folder).

The package manager used is [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), and three scripts are configured in [package.json](package.json) to help you:
 
1. To type-check your js/jsx code using [flow](https://flow.org/en/docs/react/components/), execute

    > yarn flow

1. To build the javascript source in `build.js`, execute

    > yarn build

1. To preview the site locally, execute

    > yarn start

Happy building!


## Acknowledgements

This repo was created by [Frank Dellaert](http://dellaert.github.io/), with help from Sushmita Warrier and Varun Agrawal, based on boilerplate by [Allison Zadrozny](https://www.allizad.com/) and described in [this blog post](https://medium.com/@allizadrozny/using-webpack-and-react-with-jekyll-cfe137f8a2cc). 

Changes with respect to Allison's code:
- dependencies were brought up to date to 2020 
- demoes multiple React components on page
- switched to [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager
- added [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started/introduction), loaded via CDN
- added [flow](https://flow.org/en/docs/react/components/), because why go without type-checking, ever?
