## Introduction
This page combines static html generated by [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) from markdown files that can include multiple React components. It is generated from the files in the gh-pages branch of [this github repo](https://github.com/dellaert/gh-pages-jekyll-react). 

Below is one component:

<div id="component_1"></div>

And here is another one:

<div id="component_2"></div>

In addition, as is customary with Jekyll sites, the `News` tab is generated based on markdown files in the `_posts` folder.

## Code Structure
The above is rendered based on this markdown code in `index.md`:

```md
Below is one component:

<div id="component_1"></div>

And here is another one:

<div id="component_2"></div>
```

and the code in `src/entry.js` which renders the React components in `src/components` into the divs above:

```js
render(<Component1 />, document.getElementById('component_1'));
render(<Component2 />, document.getElementById('component_2'));
```

The components in the `src/components` folders are based on deliberately kept simple.

## Development
To start development based on this, clone this hithub template, and check out the gh-pages branch and edit the .md and .jsx files (in the src folder).

The package manger use is yarn. To build the javascript source in `build.js`, execute

```sh
> yarn build
```

To preview the site locally, execute

```sh
> yarn start
```

Happy building!
