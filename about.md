This is the base Jekyll and Webpack boilerplate, created and maintained by [@allizad](https://github.com/allizad).

You can learn more about how this was put together in my walkthrough post here:
- [Using Webpack and React withÂ Jekyll](https://medium.com/allizad/)

See the full series of adding search to Jekyll, for which this project was a building block, here:

Thanks! Now go build shit!
